#
# Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and
# '0's (water), return the number of islands.
#
# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands
# horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all
# surrounded by water.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: grid = [
# ⁠ ["1","1","1","1","0"],
# ⁠ ["1","1","0","1","0"],
# ⁠ ["1","1","0","0","0"],
# ⁠ ["0","0","0","0","0"]
# ]
# Output: 1
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: grid = [
# ⁠ ["1","1","0","0","0"],
# ⁠ ["1","1","0","0","0"],
# ⁠ ["0","0","1","0","0"],
# ⁠ ["0","0","0","1","1"]
# ]
# Output: 3
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# m == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 300
# grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
#
