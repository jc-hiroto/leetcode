#
# Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the k^th
# smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is n.
# 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4
# 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete
# operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you
# optimize?

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        def inorder(node):
            if node:
                return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right)
            return []
        return inorder(root)[k - 1]
