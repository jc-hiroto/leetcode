# Testcase Example:  '[[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]'
#
# You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three
# values:
#
#
# 0 representing an empty cell,
# 1 representing a fresh orange, or
# 2 representing a rotten orange.
#
#
# Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten
# orange becomes rotten.
#
# Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a
# fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
# Output: 4
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never
# rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: grid = [[0,2]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer
# is just 0.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# m == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 10
# grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
#
