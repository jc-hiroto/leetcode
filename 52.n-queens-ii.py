# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard
# such that no two queens attack each other.
# 
# Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to theÂ n-queens
# puzzle.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as
# shown.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 1
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n <= 9
#
