# Testcase Example:  '"3+2*2"'
#
# Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and
# return its value.Â 
#
# The integer division should truncate toward zero.
#
# You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate
# results will be in the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].
#
# Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates
# strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "3+2*2"
# Output: 7
# Example 2:
# Input: s = " 3/2 "
# Output: 1
# Example 3:
# Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
# Output: 5
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5
# s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some
# number of spaces.
# s represents a valid expression.
# All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0,
# 2^31 - 1].
# The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
